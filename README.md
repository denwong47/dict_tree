# dict_tree
 A simple class to manage temporary Environment Variables as a context manager.

 ## dict_tree.dict_tree()
 ## Syntax:
 ```
 dict_tree.dict_tree(
     obj
 )

 ```
 `obj` can be any object. It is however not meaningful to call the function with and object that does not have a `__dict__` property.
